By connecting data to generative AI, orchestration\nframeworks like LlamaIndex can be game-changers in accelerating generative AI\ndevelopment. However, for many teams and enterprises technical challenges\nremain in getting modern LLM systems \u2013 with layers of abstraction \u2013 ready for\nthe real world.\n\nTo help, Arize and LlamaIndex are debuting an LLM tracing and observability\nplatform that works natively with the LlamaIndex and Arize ecosystem. With a\nfoundation based on [ Arize Phoenix OSS ](https://phoenix.arize.com/) , the\nhosted version of Phoenix offers the ability to persist application telemetry\ndata generated during AI development in order to better experiment, iterate,\nand collaborate in development or production.\n\nThe solution has a foundation in open source and features a fully hosted,\nonline, persistent deployment option for teams that do not want to self host.\nAI engineers can instantly log traces, persist datasets, run experiments, run\nevaluations \u2013 and share those insights with colleagues.\n\nThe new offering is available today, and can be accessed through either a\nLlamaIndex or Arize account.\n\n> \u201cWe share a vision with LlamaIndex in enabling builders to reduce the time\n> it takes to deploy generative AI into production but in a way that is super\n> battle hardened for business-critical use cases,\u201d said Jason Lopatecki, CEO\n> and Co-Founder of Arize. \u201cAs leaders in our respective spaces with a common\n> philosophy in empowering AI engineers and developers, we\u2019re uniquely\n> positioned here to do something that can move modern LLMOps forward and\n> broaden adoption.\u201d\n\n> \u201cPrototyping a RAG pipeline or agent is easy, but every AI engineer needs\n> the right data processing layer, orchestration framework, and\n> experimentation/monitoring tool in order to take these applications to\n> production. LlamaTrace by Arize offers the richest toolkit we\u2019ve seen in\n> enabling developers to observe, debug, and evaluate every granular step of a\n> very complex LLM workflow, and it nicely complements the production-ready\n> data platform and orchestration framework that LlamaCloud and LlamaIndex\n> offer.\u201d - Jerry Liu, CEO of LlamaIndex\n\n**About Arize AI**\n\nArize AI is an AI observability and LLM evaluation platform that helps teams\ndeliver and maintain more successful AI in production. Arize\u2019s automated\nmonitoring and observability platform allows teams to quickly detect issues\nwhen they emerge, troubleshoot why they happened, and improve overall\nperformance across both traditional ML and generative use cases.
