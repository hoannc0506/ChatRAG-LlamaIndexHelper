Enterprises are\nincreasingly looking to adopt generative AI to drive business transformation,\nbut face challenges around protecting IP, ensuring security and compliance,\nand moving smoothly from proof of concept to production.\n\nThat\u2019s why LlamaIndex is excited to announce that it is integrated with [\nNVIDIA NIM inference microservices\n](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/generative-ai-microservices-for-\ndevelopers) to help enterprises seamlessly deploy generative AI at scale.\nNVIDIA NIM, part of the [ NVIDIA AI Enterprise ](https://www.nvidia.com/en-\nus/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/) software platform, optimizes inference\non more than two dozen popular AI models from NVIDIA and its partner\necosystem.\n\nLlamaIndex is an open-source tool for connecting your data to LLMs and\nextracting valuable insights. By integrating NVIDIA NIM runtimes with\nLlamaIndex\u2019s data connection capabilities, enterprises will be able to:\n\n  * Connect generative AI models hosted using NVIDIA NIM to their own proprietary data sources, allowing them to generate accurate model outputs while keeping sensitive data secure \n  * Search across and extract insights from both structured and unstructured enterprise data to enhance the knowledge and accuracy of AI models \n  * Build data-enriched generative AI applications for use cases like enterprise search, question answering, analytics, and more \n\nFor developers, using NVIDIA NIM with LlamaIndex provides a seamless path from\nexperimentation to production. They can access the NIM microservices from the\nnewly launched NVIDIA API catalog to quickly build AI applications using\nindustry-standard protocols, and then easily transition those applications to\nwork on their self-hosted NVIDIA NIM instance for enhanced security,\ncustomization, and cost effectiveness at scale.\n\nThe combination of NVIDIA NIM for optimized model inference and LlamaIndex\u2019s\ndata connection helps unlock the full potential of enterprise-level generative\nAI. We look forward to seeing the innovative applications that emerge from\nthis integration as more organizations embrace AI to transform their business.\n\nYou can expect an in-depth technical blog post about how to use NVIDIA NIM and\nLlamaIndex very soon!", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2284, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/metadata": {"df2bef47-8560-4aed-8fa0-81ddcb05201c": {"doc_hash": "2fdd78a2609d379417db490b5d638fe1bb4cc4c320b61a4f6cb0db95e9224778", "ref_doc_id": "5d7c85a7-8efe-4b09-a876-91dc825de4fe"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"5d7c85a7-8efe-4b09-a876-91dc825de4fe": {"node_ids": ["df2bef47-8560-4aed-8fa0-81ddcb05201c"], "metadata": {"filename": "llamaindex-accelerates-enterprise-generative-ai-with-nvidia-nim.md", "extension": ".md", "title": "LlamaIndex Accelerates Enterprise Generative AI with NVIDIA NIM", "date": "Mar 18, 2024", "url": "https://www.llamaindex.ai/blog/llamaindex-accelerates-enterprise-generative-ai-with-nvidia-nim"}}}}
