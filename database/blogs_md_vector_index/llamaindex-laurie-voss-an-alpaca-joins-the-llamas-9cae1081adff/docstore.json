To\nsummarize that post: until now computers have been very good at ingesting,\nsorting, and transmitting data, but understanding what they were working with\nwas beyond them. Very recently, with tools like [ GPT-4\n](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4) and [ Llama 2\n](https://ai.meta.com/llama/) that threshold has been crossed. Software can\nnow read, summarize, and make novel connections within arbitrarily large sets\nof data. It can write software, it can use tools, it can generate text, images\nand music. A huge new set of capabilities have been unlocked.\n\nThe last time I saw a shift this big in the technological landscape was\nprobably the original iPhone. Suddenly, everybody who was doing everything\nneeded to also do it for mobile devices. You sell real estate? Now you do it\nwith an app. You run a dating site? Now you do it with an app. There was a\ngigantic rush as everyone who did everything in software suddenly saw huge\nbenefits from moving onto a new platform.\n\nBut the most interesting applications that platform shift enabled were the\nones that couldn\u2019t have existed before. Uber relies on everyone \u2014 drivers as\nwell as customers \u2014 already owning a piece of mobile hardware that can connect\nto the Internet and use GPS to locate them. Prior to the mobile revolution,\nthat would have been an absurd business plan. After it happened, it was taken\nfor granted. So in the same way, I\u2019m especially interested in seeing what the\napplications of LLMs are that were simply impossible before.\n\nAll of which is why I\u2019m delighted to be at a company at the center of the LLM\nuniverse. If you\u2019re new to LlamaIndex, it\u2019s a Python and JavaScript framework\nthat lets you quickly put together totally customizable, production-class\napplications that use LLMs. We let you ingest data from dozens of sources and\nuse any model you want, and we make it simple to link everything together.\n\nThe team at LlamaIndex is absolutely amazing and I am looking forward to\nworking with Jerry, Simon and Yi. Yi will be focusing more on partnerships.\n\nWant to see a demo? Our [ SEC Insights ](https://www.secinsights.ai/) app lets\nyou ingest regulatory documents from major corporations and then ask questions\nabout them. Want to dive and build your own? Get started in [ Python\n](https://gpt-\nindex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/installation.html) or [\nJavaScript ](https://ts.llamaindex.ai/) !\n\nP.S. If you\u2019re wondering \u201cwhy an alpaca?\u201d it\u2019s because my [ personal mascot\n](https://seldo.com/images/processed/floof-with-border.svg) is an alpaca and\nhas been for years.
