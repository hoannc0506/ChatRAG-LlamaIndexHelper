We\u2019re thrilled to announce a major\nmilestone: LlamaIndex has hit **1 million monthly downloads** on our Python\npackage! A big thank you to everyone for your support, feedback, and\ncontributions that have fueled our journey. Stay tuned for more exciting new\nproducts and features coming your way.\n\nIf you have a fascinating project or video you\u2019d like to share, we\u2019d love to\nsee it! Feel free to send it to us at [ news@llamaindex.ai\n](mailto:news@llamaindex.ai) . And remember to subscribe to our newsletter on\nour [ website ](https://www.llamaindex.ai/) to stay in the loop. We can\u2019t wait\nto connect with you there!\n\n**First, the highlights:**\n\n  * **Launched Llama Packs:** Prepackaged modules and templates streamlining LLM app development. [ Blog ](/introducing-llama-packs-e14f453b913a) , [ Tweet ](https://x.com/llama_index/status/1727365908119917016?s=20) . \n  * **RAGs Project:** Build your own retrieval augmented generation app just by talking. [ Project ](https://github.com/run-llama/rags) , [ Tweet ](https://x.com/llama_index/status/1727502719706132516?s=20) . \n  * **Introduced FuzzyCitationEnginePack:** Precisely aligns LLM responses to source sentences via fuzzy matching, available as an easy-to-implement LlamaPack. [ Docs ](https://t.co/xiGJCjNCfc) , [ Tweet ](https://x.com/llama_index/status/1729182899470311541?s=20) . \n\nComing up this week: on Thursday 30th our very own Yi Ding will be giving a\nworkshop on Building an Open Source RAG Application Using LlamaIndex.

These packs eliminate the need for assembling and tuning custom components for each use case. [ Blog ](/introducing-llama-packs-e14f453b913a) , [ Tweet ](https://x.com/llama_index/status/1727365908119917016?s=20) . \n  * We have introduced the RAGs project for programming AI agents using natural language, inspired by the interest in OpenAI\u2019s GPTs. Our approach involves a \u2018Builder Agent\u2019 that crafts a \u2018Custom Agent\u2019 tailored to specific tasks, incorporating tools for system prompt setting, data loading, model configuration, and RAG parameter adjustments. [ Project ](https://github.com/run-llama/rags) , [ Tweet ](https://x.com/llama_index/status/1727502719706132516?s=20) . \n  * We introduced a LlamaPack that enables the setup of a fully local RAG pipeline with just one line of code. This pack includes Zephyr-7b as the LLM and bge-base as the embedding model. [ Docs ](https://t.co/IGIyPl5iE2) , [ Tweet ](https://x.com/llama_index/status/1728931304211951944?s=20) . \n  * We introduced ` **FuzzyCitationEnginePack** ` that maps parts of an LLM-generated response from a RAG pipeline to the exact sentences in the source context using fuzzy matching. This innovation elevates citation accuracy and is now available as a LlamaPack for easy implementation with just one line of code. [ Docs ](https://t.co/xiGJCjNCfc) , [ Tweet ](https://x.com/llama_index/status/1729182899470311541?s=20) . \n\n**Demo:**\n\n  * AI-Einblick Prompt is a JupyterLab extension that uses OpenAI\u2019s GPT 3.5 and 4, powered by LlamaIndex, to assist in data science workflows by generating, modifying, and fixing code, creating charts, and building models, seamlessly integrated within the JupyterLab environment. [ Project ](https://pypi.org/project/ai-einblick-prompt/) , [ Tweet ](https://x.com/llama_index/status/1727492316242583571?s=20) . \n  * [ **Ranya Khemiri** ](https://twitter.com/khemiri_ranya) uploaded a research paper to RAGs to help with a school assignment and observed results better than file retrieval with ChatGPT. [ Blog ](https://raniaprojects.wixsite.com/raniakhemiri/post/i-set-up-a-rag-pipeline-to-help-with-a-school-assignment) , [ Tweet ](https://x.com/llama_index/status/1728581037863961019?s=20) . \n\n**Integrations:**\n\n  * [ CogniSwitch ](https://twitter.com/CogniSwitch?lang=en) introduced a fusion RAG approach combining vectors, knowledge graphs, and rules for streamlined ingestion and retrieval. This allows for flexible usage, either as an independent query engine or as an integrated tool within an agent with LlamaIndex.

We also provide insights into multi-modal support for vector stores, focusing on image support with future audio/video integration. \n  * [ Guide ](https://gradient.ai/blog/rag-101-for-enterprise) on getting started with AI in your enterprise from Gradient AI. This introductory guide explains retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), its relevance for businesses, and how to balance fine-tuning, prompt engineering, and RAG for optimal results, along with strategies for RAG optimization. \n\n**Tutorials:**\n\n  * [ Ankush k Singal ](https://medium.com/@andysingal) made a [ tutorial ](https://t.co/qabwKVuPSJ) on Document Extraction with Zephyr 7b LLM using LlamaIndex. \n  * [ Wenqi Glantz ](https://twitter.com/wenqi_glantz) made a [ tutorial ](https://t.co/93XM9BnaCF) on Automating Hyperparameter Tuning with LlamaIndex. \n  * [ Tonic AI ](https://twitter.com/tonicfakedata) [ analysis ](https://www.tonic.ai/blog/rag-evaluation-series-validating-rag-performance-openai-vs-llamaindex) on OpenAI Assistant API vs LlamaIndex RAG. \n  * [ **Pradip Nichite** ](https://twitter.com/pradip_nichite) made ****a ****video [ tutorial ](https://t.co/v4TsPF9xmt) on using RAGs which provides easy-to-follow instructions on how to build or customize a chatbot capable of advanced summarization over your data, making it accessible even for non-developers. \n\n**Webinars:**\n\n  * Jerry Liu presented a [ webinar ](https://arize.com/resource/advanced-llm-evals/) with Arize AI on LLM Retrieval Evaluations.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 6497, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/metadata": {"8d5a86a3-4973-4792-b8dc-ffc16f99925e": {"doc_hash": "5464e71ccddd45c343d3817b2e882edeee1d6fb23d2e002f5d7abcb6ec49d5b6", "ref_doc_id": "3bd1de6b-771d-4074-9302-a24f06b58213"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"3bd1de6b-771d-4074-9302-a24f06b58213": {"node_ids": ["8d5a86a3-4973-4792-b8dc-ffc16f99925e"], "metadata": {"filename": "llamaindex-newsletter-2023-11-28-a31be430a786.md", "extension": ".md", "title": "LlamaIndex Newsletter 2023\u201311\u201328", "date": "Nov 28, 2023", "url": "https://www.llamaindex.ai/blog/llamaindex-newsletter-2023-11-28-a31be430a786"}}}}
