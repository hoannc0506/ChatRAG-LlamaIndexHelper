As such, a crucial\ncomponent to a RAG system is the data source from which it gets its knowledge.\nIt\u2019s intuitive then to reason that the more knowledge that the RAG system can\ntap into, the better it would ultimately become (in terms of answering queries\nof potentially both depth and breadth). The spirit of this concept is not so\ndifferent from that found in basically every other data-driven discipline \u2014\naccess to more (good) data, that is subsequently and effectively used, usually\nleads to better outcomes.\n\nIt is with that backdrop, that we\u2019re thrilled to announce the release of our\nnewest latest ` llama-index ` library extension, called ` llama-index-networks\n` . This library extension makes it possible to build a network of RAGs built\non top of external data sources and supplied by external actors. This new\nnetwork paradigm allows for a new way for data suppliers to provide their data\nto those who want it in order to build more knowledgeable systems!\n\nIn this blog post, we\u2019ll introduce the main classes of the new extension\nlibrary and show you how in just a couple lines of code, you can make your\nQueryEngine ready to contribute as part of a network of RAGs. We\u2019ll also share\nideas of what this can mean for how data suppliers actually supply their data\nto consumers within this new era of LLMs.\n\nA note on terminology: in this post, we use ` llama-index-networks ` to refer\nto the actual extension, whereas ` llama-index[networks] ` refers to an\ninstallation of ` llama-index ` that comes with the ` llama-index-networks `\nextension.",
